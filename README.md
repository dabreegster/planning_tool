# Connectivity planning tool

## Development


The stack:

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) as the build tool
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) as the UI framework
- [Carbon](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-components-svelte) as the component library
- [MapLibre GL](https://maplibre.org) as the map

You'll need
[npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm). Run
`npm install` once. Use `npm run dev` to work locally. To auto-format code,
`npm run fmt`. To check for warnings, `npm run lint`. To check for errors, `npm
run check`.
